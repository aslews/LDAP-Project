Contributing to LDAP-Project
We welcome and appreciate contributions to the LDAP-Project! Whether you're helping improve documentation, fixing bugs, adding new features, or enhancing security, your contributions make a difference. This guide outlines the process for contributing to the project, ensuring that changes are made efficiently and securely.

Project Overview
The LDAP-Project automates the setup and configuration of an LDAP server using a Vagrantfile for Ubuntu Bionic, Python and Bash automation scripts, LDIF files, and includes threat models (STRIDE) in both JSON and PDF formats. Proper usage and security are paramount in this project.

How to Contribute

1. Reporting Issues
If you encounter a bug, security issue, or have a suggestion for an improvement, please report it by opening a GitHub issue:

Use clear and descriptive language.
Provide as much context as possible (e.g., environment, operating system, Vagrant or LDAP version, etc.).
Include logs, error messages, or screenshots if applicable.

2. Fork the Repository
To contribute code or documentation, start by forking the repository:

Fork this repository by clicking the "Fork" button at the top.

Clone your fork locally:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/LDAP-project.git
cd LDAP-project

3. Set the upstream repository:

git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner/LDAP-project.git

4. Always keep your fork up to date:

git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main

3. Making Changes

a. Code Contributions
Automation Scripts: When working on Python or Bash automation scripts, ensure that your contributions maintain or improve the automation of LDAP setup and configuration. Be mindful of security best practices.
LDIF Files: Make sure that any LDAP Directory Interchange Format (LDIF) files you contribute or modify are correctly formatted and functional.
Vagrantfile: Changes to the Vagrantfile should streamline the setup process, enhance compatibility, or improve server performance and security.
STRIDE Threat Model: If you're contributing to or updating the threat model (JSON or PDF format), ensure that it properly reflects potential threats (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege).

b. Documentation
README Files: Ensure that all changes to documentation, usage guides, or readmes are clear and up-to-date. Every new feature should have an accompanying update to the documentation.
Security Guidelines: If adding security features or mitigating a risk, include detailed information in the relevant documentation or STRIDE threat model.

c. Testing
Test all changes locally before submitting your pull request (PR). For scripts, provide usage instructions and logs of your test results.
If you're making security updates, include details of the testing procedures and potential impact on users.

4. Commit Guidelines
Commit Message Format: Use clear and concise commit messages that describe the changes being made:
For bug fixes: fix: description of the bug
For new features: feat: description of the feature
For documentation: docs: updated documentation
For security: sec: fixed vulnerability in X
Code Style:
Python scripts should adhere to PEP 8 coding standards.
Bash scripts should be POSIX-compliant.
Make sure your code is clean and readable. Include comments where necessary.

5. Submitting a Pull Request
Once you're ready to submit your changes:

Ensure your branch is up-to-date with the main branch:

git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main

Push your changes:

git push origin your-branch

Create a Pull Request (PR) from your fork to the main branch of the LDAP-Project repo. In your PR description, include:

A brief explanation of the changes.
Reference any related issue (e.g., "Closes #123").
Detailed steps on how to test the changes, if applicable.
Ensure that your PR passes all continuous integration (CI) checks (if applicable).

6. Code Reviews
Maintainers will review your pull request and may request changes. Be open to feedback and be prepared to:

Refactor or clarify your code if requested.
Address security or performance concerns raised during the review process.
Respond to questions about your implementation.

7. Security Considerations
Security is a key priority for this project. Please keep the following in mind:

Report any security vulnerabilities privately by contacting the maintainers directly before opening an issue or PR.
When adding new features, be mindful of potential attack vectors and update the threat model accordingly.
Contributions should align with the STRIDE threat model principles (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege).

8. Contributor License Agreement (CLA)
By contributing to this repository, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the same license as this repository.

We look forward to your contributions and thank you for helping make the LDAP-Project better!
